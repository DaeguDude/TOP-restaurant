## TOP - Restaurant

## 0819

I'm going through the project instruction of The Odin Project. I am not too sure what this all webpack thing is working, but I will complete first and try to understand little details using [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc)

> Create a bare-bons homepage for a restaurant. Include an image, headline, and save copy about how wonderful the restaurant is. It's okay to hard-code these into the HTML for now just to see how they look on the page.

Okay, now I'm at the task4 written above. Let's list the things that I need to do.

1. Decide how your layout will look like(Find a simple restaurant website you want to copy)

2. What type of food your website is about?

3. Prototyping using Figma

  - What device?

### Decide how your layout will look like(Find a simple restaurant website you want to copy)

I've looked at some examples for simple restaurnat websites from [sitebuilderreport](https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/inspiration/restaurant-websites?a=ga&gclid=CjwKCAjwm_P5BRAhEiwAwRzSO8z_wiSp2CKY2-GcbwUferZ04n2apNvlLB1e45rG1X-2hAR8G5_l-RoCAZ0QAvD_BwE), and I decided to do this one.

Landing Page

Other Main Pages

### What type of food your website is about?

My website will be about Korean food since I'm a Korean. I guess I will need to find some quality photos for Korean food.

### Prototype using Figma

#### Home

#### About
![about](./img/prototype/about.png)

#### Menu

#### Contact

So this is how my website will look like! Now it is time for actual coding!
